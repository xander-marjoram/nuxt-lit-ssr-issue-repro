# Nuxt 3 Minimal Starter

Look at the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# yarn
yarn install
```

## Building locally

You may need to run `npx nuxt build` to generate the `.nuxt` directory. This will then fail with a rollup error but after that you can run `yarn build` which runs rollup.

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3002`:

There will likely be some errors but the site still runs well enough to reproduce the issue.

```bash
# yarn
yarn dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
# yarn
yarn build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
# yarn
yarn preview
```

Check out the [deployment documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment) for more information.
